The Intelligent Systems, Content & Interaction Lab (<a href='http://www.image.ntua.gr'>ISCIL</a>) was established in 1989, in the School of Computer and Electrical Engineering and the Institute of Computer and Communication Systems of NTUA. ISCIL has a leading expertise in theoretical and experimental aspects of machine learning and intelligent systems, related to analysis of information, knowledge extraction & representation, adaptation to context and extensive collaborative, coordinating and administrative experience. It has been successfully involved in more than a hundred European R&D projects in its fields of R&D. Since 2004, ISCIL is the main body that drives technological progress forward in the fields of digitisation, documentation and identification of cultural content on a national and European scale, actively participating as a technical partner in the creation and development of the European Digital Library - Europeana. ISCIL has developed and supported the MINT platform, which is used by more than 550 cultural organizations for the processing and publication of more than 25 million items in the Europeana Web portal. The platform continues to support important European thematic aggregators of cultural content in areas such as museums, audiovisual archives, immovable monuments, photography, clothing and fashion, social history and labour movements, etc. ISCIL has also implemented the collaborative platform <a href='https://withculture.eu'>WITH</a>, that provides access to digital cultural heritage items from different repositories and offers a number of added-value services for the creative reuse and intelligent exploitation of that content.",

  "efia-text"   : "The Department of Informatics was founded by the Greek Ministry of National Education and Religious Affairs in 2004 and its scope covers Theoretical, as well as Applied Informatics. It is located in the city of Corfu, Greece. The mission of the Department is to advance scientific and research activities not already covered by existing university departments throughout Greece and foster innovation and partnerships in advanced technological fields by bridging the gap between businesses and academia. As a result, its function is complementary to that of similar departments in Greece and is clearly focused on novel applications in the areas of Information Systems and Humanistic Informatics. Information Systems, on the one hand, is a crucial factor regarding production, innovation services and management in enterprises nowadays. Humanistic Informatics, on the other hand, addresses the needs for education and research within the area of Informatics, and tones in with the nature of the Ionian University. In addition to the educational focus, one of the key activities of the Department of Informatics of the Ionian University is research. More specifically, the Department's research activities are orientated towards the development of novel applications in the aforementioned research areas of Information Systems and Humanistic Informatics. The fields of current research interest in the of Department focus on several thematic units, such as Knowledge Management & Acquisition, Innovation & Entrepreneurship, Tourism Informatics, Performance Analysis & Scalability issues, Databases & Information Systems, Biometrics, Computational grids and Artificial Intelligence. Moreover, Ionian University's 6.000+ undergraduate and graduate students collaborate with more than 150 faculty members and staff in its campuses scattered around Ionian Islands. It holds a large experience in combing Information & Communication Technologies with both the entrepreneurship and innovation sectors through its implementation of related European regional and national projects, as well as implementing new strategies in related entrepreneurial fields. <br> Following a history of over 10 years, the Humanistic & Social Informatics Laboratory was officially founded in February 2019 (Official Government Gazette of the Hellenic Republic, O.G.G. 273/B/07.02.2019) and its scope covers applied computing and informatics. The lab focuses on the one hand on the application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to the extraction, representation and processing of humanistic and social data that is derived from the respective scientific and artistic areas, like psychology, linguistics, history, archeology, philosophy, anthropology, social studies, music and arts. On the other hand, it employs methodologies adapted from these scientific and artistic areas in order to supply ICT products and services with optimum quality and a human-centered perspective. The Lab members' interests lie within educational, research and development activities in the areas of cultural informatics, music informatics, history informatics, computational linguistics, game software design and development, multimedia, virtual reality, image processing, ICT in education, knowledge representation and management, computer-supported cooperative systems, ubiquitous computing, digital media, semantic space modeling, web sentiment analysis, and the Semantic Web. The Lab has acquired more than 1.5M € in past R&D national and European projects' funding, while it is currently managing ongoing funding activities of approx. 1M €.

The Department for Digital Innovation (<a href='http://www.culture.gouv.fr/Thematiques/Innovation-numerique/'>DIN</a>) within the General Secretariat of the FMC is especially in charge of implementing the digital strategy of the Ministry. The DIN develops valuation on digital uses and technologies and foster the dissemination of knowledge and best practices on the cultural digital field. Its main aim is to foster the democratisation of Culture through the development of digital access to cultural resources for all audiences. For this, the ministry develops or supports new services for the different kind of public (pupils, students, general etc), such as the portal \"Collections\" on <a href='http://www.culture.fr'>culture.fr</a>, that proposes a unique gateway to more than 4 million digitised items. The DIN also coordinates the “<a href='http://data.culturecommunication.gouv.fr'>platform for cultural Open Data</a>” that provides datasets from the ministry and its cultural institutions and also ready-to-use facilities. For enabling participation from citizen, open access should be fostered, FMC has launched a platform for Open Data (data.culturecommunication.gouv.fr) in December 2016 to provide open public data so any citizen or user communities can access and reuse them."
