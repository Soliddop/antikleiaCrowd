				<p>Discover digital artifacts, exhibits and collections from museums and archives all around the world. Explore cultural treasures in extraordinary detail from hidden gems to great masterpieces. Experiment with open and protected digital cultural content and unlock your creativity!</p>

				<p>WITH is a platform that exposes APIs from different portals and repositories. It allows you to search for digital content from a range of different and unconnected repositories and databases from a single access point.  Searchable repositories include Europeana, the Digital Public Library of America, YouTube, Rijks Museum, National Library of Australia, Digital New Zeeland and other.</p>

				<p>WITH is available for cultural institutions and organizations, professional users and third party developers in order to easily search for the cultural resources that meet their retrieval criteria so as to collect, use and re-use them to promote innovation and demonstrate the social and economic value of cultural content.</p>

				<p>WITH was designed and developed in alignment with complementary services used and produced in the Europeana ecosystem, and informed by the design of respective infrastructures being developed such as Europeana Labs , the Europeana Cloud  and LoCloud , and of more specialized applications targeting cultural heritage content visualization and re-use, such as the tools and pilots of AthenaPlus  and EUscreen.</p>
